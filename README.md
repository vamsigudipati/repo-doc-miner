# repo-doc-miner (v2 — Topology-First)

A CodeBuddy / Claude-Code compatible **Skill** that mines an existing Git
repository using a two-stage **topology-first → module-deep-dive** method and
produces a coordinated Markdown doc set:

- `topology.md` — **the primary deliverable**: a structural map (Mermaid diagrams) + entity inventory of the repository.
- `developer_guide.md` — architecture tours, module breakdowns, extension SOPs.
- `user_guide.md` — installation through advanced user-facing features.
- `tutorial.md` — a beginner-to-expert, chapter-by-chapter learning path.
- `README.md` — a navigation hub that links the four documents.

Every claim is grounded in the actual code, configuration, and examples of the
target repository — not generic knowledge.

## What changed in v2

v1 scanned files flatly and produced three documents. v2 **leads with a topology
map**: it enumerates the repository's *entity types* (modules, skills, agents,
commands, connectors, packages, scripts…) and extracts the *dependency edges*
between them — especially `source → copy` edges where one file is a synced copy
of a single source of truth. The topology map is the first deliverable and the
backbone for the other documents. This ordering is what lets the skill scale to
very large repositories: it collapses O(N) files into an O(entity-type)
structure and tells the agent *which* files to read *in what order*.

The key new piece is `scripts/gen_topology.py`, which auto-generates the map; a
human then refines the detected edges by reading the most important manifests.

## Installation

Drop the whole folder into your agent's skill directory:

- **CodeBuddy (project-scoped)**: `<repo>/.codebuddy/skills/repo-doc-miner/`
- **CodeBuddy (user-scoped)**: `~/.codebuddy/skills/repo-doc-miner/`

The agent auto-discovers the skill via `SKILL.md`.

## Quick Start

Once installed, trigger the skill with a request like:

- "挖掘当前项目，先给我拓扑图，再生成开发者文档、用户文档和从入门到精通教程"
- "Mine this repo, draw an architecture topology, and produce docs under `docs/guides/`"

The skill will:

1. **Generate the topology** with `scripts/gen_topology.py` (Phase 1), then refine the detected edges.
2. **Deep-dive modules along the edges** to gather grounded evidence (Phase 2).
3. **Draft and write** the four documents via the templates (Phases 3–4).
4. **Validate** snippet fidelity, edge reality, and Markdown rendering (Phase 5), then hand over (Phase 6).

You can also run the generators manually:

```bash
# Stage 1: draw the topology map
python scripts/gen_topology.py <repo-root> \
    --project-name "<DisplayName>" \
    --out <repo-root>/docs/guides/topology.md

# Stage 4: scaffold the four doc skeletons (fills {{PROJECT_NAME}})
python scripts/scaffold_docs.py <repo-root> \
    --project-name "<DisplayName>" [--out docs/guides] [--force]
```

## Design Principles

- **Topology-first** — map the structure and dependencies before reading details; the map is the first deliverable.
- **Edge-ordered reading** — understand a single source of truth before its synced copies.
- **Ground every claim in code** — file paths and symbol names accompany every feature description.
- **Prefer real snippets** from `examples/` or tests, capped at ~30 lines.
- **Cross-link** the four documents so any one of them is a valid entry point.
- **Mark unresolved gaps** with `TODO(doc-miner)` instead of fabricating behavior.

See `SKILL.md` for the full six-phase workflow and `references/topology_method.md`
for the methodology and how to extend the topology detector to new repo families.
